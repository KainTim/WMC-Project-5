# Concept

- Homescreen
  The homescreen of the App should display a list of upcoming tournaments
  and a button to a tournament you are participating in.
  If you press on a tournament in the list, the detail view should open
- Tournament Detail View
  The tournament detail view displays all the information about a tournament,
  like
- The registration period
- The maximum amount of teams
- Preview pictures
- A button for registering your Team if in the registration period
- A button to view the stats of the tournament if it has been completed or is currently ongoing
