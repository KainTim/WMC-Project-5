# Splatoon Tournament Manager

## Explanation

I implemented a tournament manager for Splatoon in the past, but it was for one client only, so the participating teams couldn't see their score.
This new version is written in Flutter for Android and uses websockets to display your current ranking and information about the past matches during the tournament.
The Backend is written in Express/JS and communicates with the frontend using both REST endpoints and Websockets while using an SQLite database for persistance.
